### 💻 **Technical Implementation:**

```html
<!-- Each button triggers the analytics with natural language queries -->
<button onclick="sendInsightQuery('Show me our hiring success rate')" 
        class="analytics-btn" 
        style="background: rgba(255,248,240,0.8); border: 1px solid #ffcc80; color: #e65100;">
  📊 Hiring Success Rate
</button>
```

### 🎯 **User Experience:**

**After:** One-click access to all 10 comprehensive analytics insights!

### 📱 **Mobile-Friendly:**

- Responsive design works on phones, tablets, and desktops

### 🔗 **Integration:**

The buttons use the existing `sendInsightQuery()` function which:
- Sends natural language queries to your enhanced analytics functions
